# 777Club Task Test

This project is about the NFTs where you can add your NFTs 
collection. 


## Appendix

The website is fully responsive for every screen for exmaple
Desktop, Laptop, Ipad, Phone etc...

I made the responsive design by myself because you didn't provide
me the resposive design. The design was just for Desktop and laptop.

The website has 7 sections and it is a single page website.

I also add the scroll effect for the links and the Nav menu for
mobiles which i made is by myself... the colors are used from the 
project. 

The more information about the project will be discused in the 
loom video.
